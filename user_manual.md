# Solar Flare Activity Monitor (SFAM) User Manual

## Overview
The Solar Flare Activity Monitor (SFAM) is a device designed to detect and analyze solar flare activities. It uses sensors to detect changes in solar radiation, particularly during solar flares, which can have significant effects on satellite communications and power grids on Earth. This manual will guide you through the setup and usage of the SFAM.

## Setup
1. Connect the SFAM to a power source.
2. Connect the SFAM to your computer or smartphone via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
3. Install the accompanying app on your computer or smartphone.

## Usage
1. Power on the SFAM.
2. The SFAM will automatically start detecting solar radiation and logging data.
3. You can view the logged data and analysis results on the accompanying app.

## Software Components
The SFAM software consists of several components:

### Sensor Driver (`sensor_driver.c`)
This component is responsible for interacting with the radiation sensor. It initializes the sensor, reads data from it, and closes it when it's no longer needed.

### Data Processing (`data_processing.c`)
This component logs the sensor data and analyzes it. It calculates the average and maximum sensor data and clears the data log when it's full.

### Alert System (`alert_system.c`)
This component checks the current sensor data and triggers an alert if the data exceeds a certain threshold.

### Main Program (`main.c`)
This is the main program that ties all the components together. It initializes the sensor, reads data from it, logs the data, checks for alerts, and then waits for a certain period before repeating the process.

## Hardware Components
The SFAM hardware consists of several components:

### Radiation Sensor
This is the sensor that detects solar radiation. It's connected to a specific pin on the microcontroller.

### Microcontroller
This is the brain of the SFAM. It controls the sensor and processes the sensor data.

### Wi-Fi or Bluetooth Module
This module allows the SFAM to transmit data to your computer or smartphone in real time.

### Display Screen or Smartphone App Interface
This is where you can view the logged data and analysis results.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any problems while using the SFAM, please refer to the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Check the power source. Make sure the SFAM is properly connected to a power source and that the power source is working.
2. Check the sensor. Make sure the sensor is properly connected to the microcontroller and that it's working.
3. Check the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection. Make sure the SFAM is properly connected to your computer or smartphone.
4. Check the accompanying app. Make sure the app is properly installed and running on your computer or smartphone.

If you still can't resolve the problem, please contact our support team for further assistance.

## Safety Precautions
Please observe the following safety precautions while using the SFAM:

1. Do not expose the SFAM to extreme temperatures or humidity.
2. Do not expose the SFAM to physical shock or vibration.
3. Do not disassemble the SFAM. If it needs repair, please contact our support team.
4. Keep the SFAM out of reach of children.

## Conclusion
The SFAM is a powerful tool for detecting and analyzing solar flare activities. We hope this manual helps you get the most out of it. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us.
